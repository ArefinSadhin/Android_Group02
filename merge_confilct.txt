Hey Mustafiz again I conflicted this file again. This is Working fine. Thank your for your cooperation. I have an idea lets add binary search code here

val list = mutableListOf('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e')
println(list.binarySearch('d')) // 3

list.remove('d')

val invertedInsertionPoint = list.binarySearch('d')
val actualInsertionPoint = -(invertedInsertionPoint + 1)
println(actualInsertionPoint) // 3

list.add(actualInsertionPoint, 'd')
println(list) // [a, b, c, d, e]
